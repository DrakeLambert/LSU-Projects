# Proposal for a Peer Mentor Web Service

## Motivation

When I first arrived at LSU, like my peers, I was overwhelmed with the amount of available opportunities and information that was being sent my way. It was difficult to sort through all of the stimulus to find the things that mattered to me, and it was hard to notice the small things that would end up having a large impact on my college career. Living in a dormitory for my first two years at LSU, I became aware that many of my peers faced the same challenge. We were all going through the motions, but we still couldn't find quite the right answers.

During my first semester, I was fortunate to get an on campus job working at with the Network Engineering Department. Though the technical challenge of the experience was rewarding, the most important aspect of job was the mentorship I received. My mentors were my coworkers; they were nearly all seniors in Computer Science, my own major. During my first semester, I always had my coworkers to help me through the tough decisions: scheduling, housing, parking, career preparation, study habits, etc.

One of the greatest things I got from my coworkers was inspiration. I saw that others were facing the same challenges I was: being lost in a sea of information. I got to experience people giving their time to solve my problems, and I wanted to do the same.

## Description

The solution will take the form of a free online service. Students will be able to sign up and give relevant information about their studies and experience. Experience and skills will be able to be endorsed by other users akin to LinkedIn.

From there, they will be able to dynamically match with other users based on one's question and another's experience. In this way, students will not only be able to meet new mentors but also gain the experience of mentoring others.

Users will have the choice to keep up their relationships with mentors or to find new ones. Unlike most other organizations, users have the option of connecting with many mentors at once. This will allow mentors to specialize, and make sure that mentorees get the best possible information for their problem.

## Plan

I plan to tackle this challenge in the format of a design project.

This project wll be as much of a business challenge as a technological challenge. My aim is not only to build the solution, but also engage a large number of students with the goal of the project outliving my time at LSU.

The tentative steps to the completion of the project are below. I am currently in the research phase.

### Research

In the research phase, I will survey relevant organizations and potential users. This will give insight as to how others may be currently solving similar issues, and how users might want to interact with such a system.

1. Gather relevant information from LSU mentor organizations. An example organization is the Society of Peer Mentors.
    - How do you find students to mentor?
    - How do you match mentors with students?
    - What type of contact do mentors have with students (email, phone, in person)?
    - How long do students stay in contact with mentors?
    - Do mentors get any rewards for volunteering?
1. Gather relevant information on similar online platforms not necessarily related to LSU. An example service is www.Score.org.
1. Gather relevant information from the target audience: students.
    - How do you find answers for your questions regarding:
        - coursework
        - physical health
        - mental health
        - careers
        - hobbies
        - etc
    - Have you ever been mentored?
        - If so, did it help you, and how?
    - Would you be interested in the proposed service?
1. Gather relevant information from those who would be interested in being a mentor.
    - How much time would you commit to being a mentor?
    - How would you describe what topics you would like to mentor on?
    - Would you be a mentor without compensation?

### Design and Implementation

In the design and implementation phase, I will translate the real world domain knowledge gained in the research phase to first detailed plans, then code.

1. Define use cases / user stories for the service.
    - How will users use the service from both a mentor and mentoree standpoint.
1. Design the software architecture for the service.
    - Will the service be a:
        - Web service
        - Phone app
        - Web site
    - How will the service be hosted?
1. Design the software itself.
    - Use visual modeling to describe the domain of the project.
1. Implement the software design in code.

### Publication and Testing

In the publication and testing phase, I will focus on promoting the service and polishing it based on user feedback. The ultimate goal will be to hand this project off to future maintainers.

1. Make the service public.
1. Test the design with users.
    - If issues are present, go back to design and implementation.
    - If no issues are found, move on.
1. Find avenues for promoting the service.
    - LSU organizations
    - Introduction courses filled with freshmen
1. Promote the service.
    - Using promotional items
    - Using promotional activities
    - Newsletters
1. Continuously improve the mentor and mentoree experience
    - Use feedback from users
    - Constantly integrate new features
    - Constantly polish old features
1. Investigate ways for the service to transcend myself.
    - The service needs to be able to operate without me to ensure that it will really make a difference for students in the long run.
1. Hand off project to the relevant party.
    - Ideally this would be LSU, but it could also be a group of people who have the same vision as I do.

## Significance

I am a Computer Science major concentrating on Cloud Computing, and I plan to pursue a career in designing web solutions. This project will allow me to go through every motion that would be expected of me in a professional setting: from idea to the handoff of the finished product. I want to use this project to not only challenge myself technologically, but also use it to develop my product marketing skills and my user interaction skills.

I am passionate about designing solutions to real world problems. This project will be part of my expression of giving back to my community. I still haven't quite determined if I enjoy the technological design more or the internal reward I feel for making a positive difference in others' lives. I do know that wrapping them both up into one project gets me very excited!

## Budget Plan

| Item                                      |           | Cost
| ---                                       | ---       | ---
| A domain name (such as lsu.edu)           |           | $12/year
| Web hosting (2 virtual machines)          |           | $300/year
| Promotional Items (Flyers, T-shirts, etc) |           | $200
|                                           | **Total** | $512

Costs should be considered for the first year only.
